# Word-Guess-Game

Getting Started
Word Guess Game instructions:
-At the start of each game, the application selects a random word from a question array and provides 12 guesses for the word to be guessed.
-Player attemps to guess the word by selecting indiviual letters using the keyboard. Only 1 of the 26 letters of the English alphabet can be guessed. Each guess counts to the number of guesses remaining. Only unique guessed letters will be counted.
-The application display shows the selected word, with each letter hidden at the start of each game. If a letter is correctly guessed, then the letter positions in the word are revealed. The display also shows each letter that has been guessed.
-If all letters of the word are guessed before the number of guesses run out, then the planer wins and the win counter is incremented and game ends. If the number of guesses runs out before all letters of the word are guessed, then the game ends. The game automatically starts a new game and displays the previous selected word on the display. After all words from the question array have been selected, then the browser must be refreshed to try all words again.
